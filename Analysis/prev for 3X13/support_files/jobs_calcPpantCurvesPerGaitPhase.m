% This script is called from JOBS_import_preprocess.m
% It assigns gate phases to each event in each participant's trial summary,
% so that these events can be analysed according to walk speed, and gait
% phase.


% Assign a gate phase to each 

% Subgroup events by speed and gait phase


%Create psychometric curves for each gait phase, at each speed

% Save ppant's Alpha, Beta and R Squared for each condition
% All(phase = 1:n), Slow(phase = 1:n), Normal (phase=1:n)
